# Studio4 Development Roadmap

## Vision
**Visual Design System Builder** - A revolutionary tool that creates production-ready, tokenized components for any website. Our variable slot architecture allows ANY CSS value (not limited to presets), enabling infinite design flexibility and AI integration.

## Architecture Documentation
- **Studio4 UI**: See `STUDIO4-ARCHITECTURE.md` - Pink/tangerine theme editor interface
- **User's Design System**: See `STUDIO-SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE.md` - What users create with Studio4
- **4-Layer Architecture**: See `STUDIO-4-LAYER-ARCHITECTURE.md` - Revolutionary CSS organization
- Clear separation between the tool and its output

## Phase 1: Visual Theme Variable Editor (Current) üé®
**Goal**: Create elegant visual tools for editing design variables

### 1.1 Theme Panel Refinement
- [x] Reorganize interface with Theme as primary tab
- [x] Move HTML/CSS editing to preview area as overlays
- [x] Create accordion sections for Colors, Typography, UI, Sections
- [x] Build typography section with visual controls and live preview
- [x] Revolutionary color system with dynamic lightness control
- [x] Add visual color editor with HSL controls
- [x] JSON-based preset systems for colors and typography
- [x] Export/Import functionality for design tokens
- [ ] Integrate color presets with typography editor
- [ ] Create spacing scale visualizer
- [ ] Add variable relationship mapper

### 1.2 Inspector Refinement (Hero Test Case)
- [ ] Perfect layer-based filtering and display
- [ ] Improve editable panels and apply functionality
- [ ] Enhance component structure view
- [ ] Add visual feedback for modifications
- [ ] Expand to all components once refined

### 1.3 Variable Slot Innovation
- [x] Dynamic color generation using CSS relative color syntax
- [ ] Visual slot editor showing ANY value capability
- [ ] Gradient builder for background slots
- [ ] Calc() expression builder
- [ ] Animation value editor
- [ ] Custom unit inputs
- [ ] Saturation control for colors (not just lightness)
- [ ] Hue shifting capabilities

## Phase 2: AI Design Assistant Integration ü§ñ
**Goal**: Conversational design system creation

### 2.1 AI Foundation
- [ ] Design pattern extraction from existing sites
- [ ] Variable relationship learning
- [ ] Style consistency analyzer
- [ ] Component compatibility checker

### 2.2 Conversational Interface
- [ ] Natural language to variables ("make it more spacious")
- [ ] Image to component generation
- [ ] "Match or Update?" decision flow
- [ ] Progressive theme building through conversation

### 2.3 Smart Suggestions
- [ ] Context-aware variable recommendations
- [ ] Design coherence warnings
- [ ] Accessibility improvements
- [ ] Performance optimization hints

## Phase 3: Production Asset Pipeline üöÄ
**Goal**: Export clean, reusable code for any project

### 3.1 Export Formats
- [ ] CSS custom properties file
- [ ] JSON design tokens
- [ ] SCSS/SASS variables
- [ ] JavaScript/TypeScript tokens
- [ ] Tailwind config generator

### 3.2 Framework Adapters
- [ ] React component wrapper
- [ ] Vue component format
- [ ] Web Components output
- [ ] WordPress block structure
- [ ] Static HTML/CSS bundles

### 3.3 Documentation Generator
- [ ] Auto-generate style guide
- [ ] Component usage examples
- [ ] Variable dependency graph
- [ ] Interactive playground links

## Phase 4: Collaboration & Sharing ü§ù
**Goal**: Team-friendly design system management

### 4.1 Sharing Features
- [ ] Shareable component URLs
- [ ] Public/private component libraries
- [ ] Fork and customize workflows
- [ ] Version history tracking

### 4.2 Integration Points
- [ ] GitHub sync for version control
- [ ] Figma plugin for designers
- [ ] VS Code extension
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline integration

## Core Principles
1. **Variable Slots Over Fixed Values**: ANY valid CSS value, not limited presets
2. **Visual First**: Every feature should have a visual representation
3. **AI-Ready Architecture**: Design patterns that AI can understand and generate
4. **Production Quality**: Output clean, professional code ready for any project
5. **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, reveal power as needed
6. **ADHD-Friendly**: Clear visual hierarchy, reduced cognitive load
7. **Minimal Root Variables**: Only base colors in :root, everything else generated dynamically
8. **Infinite Flexibility**: CSS relative color syntax enables unlimited color variations

## Success Metrics
- Creates design systems as elegant as Token Studio but for web
- AI can generate new components that match existing design
- Exports work seamlessly with any framework or CMS
- Variable relationships are immediately visually clear
- Non-designers can create professional design systems
