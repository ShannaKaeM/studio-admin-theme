# CLAUDE ALWAYS RULES - Studio4 Project

**These rules apply to EVERY session and EVERY task for this project**

## **ðŸ”¥ TRIGGER PHRASE: "docs"**

**When user says "docs" - DO THIS IMMEDIATELY:**

## **SESSION WORKFLOW**
1. âœ… **Read ClaudeAlways.md** (review rules)
2. âœ… **Read and update CLAUDE.md** (get memory/context)
3. âœ… **Read PROJECT-DOCS** assessment of current status and what edits are needed
4. âœ… **Provide summary of planned updates to documents** before updating
5. âœ… **Provide summery of planned work** before implementing
6. âœ… **Get user confirmation** before proceeding

**CHECKLIST**: Each section has its own CHECKLIST.md - use those as single source of truth for what's implemented vs. what needs building. Keep checklists high level use whiteboards for details. 

**WHITEBOARD**: Each section has its own WHITEBOARD.md - use those as temporary notes and scratchpad, when task set is completed transfer the details to the DETAILS.md file, and then delete the whiteboard content for next session/tasklist.

**DETAILS**: Each section has its own DETAILS.md - use those as single source of truth for what's implemented vs. what needs building and as final reference for completed items.
