## ðŸ”® **NEXT PHASE PLANNING**

### **Priority 1: Extended Scope Library**
**Goal**: Expand beyond text scopes to complete component system

**Implementation Plan**:
- **Button Scopes** - Add `button-primary`, `button-secondary` individual scopes
- **Layout Scopes** - Add `container`, `card`, `hero` scopes  
- **Component Scopes** - Add `nav-item`, `form-field` scopes
- **Test Integration** - Verify new scopes work with color variations

### **Priority 2: Advanced Scope Features**
**Goal**: Enhance individual scope system with professional capabilities

**Planned Features**:
- **Scope Templates** - Pre-built scope collections for common use cases
- **Scope Inheritance** - Child scopes inherit properties from parent scopes
- **Scope Locking** - Prevent changes to foundational scopes
- **Bulk Operations** - Copy, duplicate, or modify multiple scopes
- **Scope Export/Import** - Share scope definitions between projects

### **Priority 3: Advanced Color Operations**
**Goal**: Professional color management capabilities

**Planned Enhancements**:
- **Color Themes** - Save complete color palettes as themes
- **Gradient Support** - HSLA gradients with multiple color stops
- **Color Harmony** - Auto-generate complementary/analogous variations
- **Accessibility Testing** - Contrast ratio validation and suggestions

### **Priority 4: Professional Features**
**Goal**: Design tool quality capabilities

**Advanced Features**:
- **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Speed up editing workflow
- **Template Library** - Pre-built component collections
- **Version Control** - Scope and color history with undo/redo
- **Export Options** - CSS, JSON, or live code generation

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

### **Session Goals (Priority Order)**
1. **Button Scope Implementation** - Add button-primary, button-secondary individual scopes
2. **Layout Scope Addition** - Add container, card, hero scopes with styling
3. **Extended Integration Testing** - Verify new scopes work with color variations
4. **Component Library Expansion** - Test scope + color combinations across different types

### **Success Criteria**
- âœ… New button and layout scopes work with existing color system
- âœ… Color variations apply correctly to all scope types
- âœ… Individual scope pattern scales smoothly to different component types
- âœ… User experience remains intuitive as scope library expands

## ðŸ“‹ **QUESTIONS FOR NEXT SESSION**

### **Technical Decisions**
1. **Button Scope Properties**: What's the core styling for button-primary vs button-secondary?
2. **Layout Scope Patterns**: How should container/card/hero scopes differ in their base properties?
3. **Scope Organization**: Should we group scopes by type (Text, Buttons, Layout) in the interface?
4. **Performance**: Any optimizations needed as scope library scales?

### **User Experience**
1. **Scope Discovery**: How do users find and understand different scope types?
2. **Scope Relationships**: Should related scopes (button-primary/secondary) be visually grouped?
3. **Template Integration**: What pre-built scope combinations would be most valuable?
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: How do we keep interface clean as scope library grows?
