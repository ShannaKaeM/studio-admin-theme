# STUDIO1 DEVELOPMENT WHITEBOARD

*Current Session: July 13, 2025*

> **Document Purpose**: Temporary workspace for current session planning. Keep this focused on immediate next steps and high-level planning only.
> 
> **Important Workflow**:
> - **Always put current work/issues at the top** - What needs attention RIGHT NOW
> - **Move completed items to 04-Doc.md** - Don't let this whiteboard become a full documentation file

## üìã **PROJECT STATUS - FOUNDATION COMPLETE**
*(High-level summary of major achievements since refactor began)*

**Revolutionary Foundation Complete:**
- ‚úÖ **Unified .one Element System** - 80+ CSS properties, --one- variables, real-time editing
- ‚úÖ **Professional Dashboard Architecture** - Two-system separation (UI vs Studio1), semantic CSS classes
- ‚úÖ **Complete Color Management** - BaseColorEditor + ColorCreator + custom variations + localStorage
- ‚úÖ **Individual Scope System** - eyebrow, title, subtitle with styling baked in + live preview
- ‚úÖ **WordPress Plugin Foundation** - Full admin interface, build system, CSS injection working

**Current Challenge:** Color integration between Color Creator and Scope Editor needs refinement

## üö® **CURRENT WORK - NEEDS ATTENTION NOW**

### **Major Architecture Decision: Single Base Color + HSLA System**
- **New Vision**: Single base color with HSLA adjustments instead of 4 separate base colors
- **Color Book**: Consolidate BaseColorEditor + ColorCreator into unified "Color Book" interface
- **Foundation Change**: Grayscale HSLA foundation with no hardcoded colors in root

### **Immediate Action Items:**
1. ‚úÖ **Clean Out Hardcoded Colors**: Removed 4-color system, replaced with grayscale foundation
2. ‚úÖ **Main.css Housekeeping**: Removed old color scales, builder colors, fixed .one element references
3. **Create Color Book Component**: Build new unified Color Book interface
4. **Update Dashboard Tabs**: Replace "Base" + "Colors" tabs with single "Color Book" tab  
5. **HSLA Adjustment System**: Design how Color Book presets modify grayscale foundation

### **Key Questions:**
- How do we apply H, S, L, A adjustments to single base color?
- What should the grayscale foundation look like in CSS?
- How will global presets modify the base color + adjustments?
- Should scopes use HSLA functions instead of hardcoded color values?

## üîÆ **FUTURE WORK - NOT CURRENT FOCUS**

## ‚ùì **QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION**

### **Color System Design**
1. **Color Selection UX**: How should users pick colors in scope editor? Dropdown vs color picker vs other?
2. **Color Preview**: Should we show color swatches in dropdowns? Live color preview?
3. **Color Application**: Should colors apply immediately or require save/apply action?
4. **Color Organization**: How should colors be grouped/organized in scope editor?

### **Scope Editor Workflow**  
1. **Property Addition**: Current 3-dropdown approach (category ‚Üí property ‚Üí value) - is this optimal?
2. **Visual Feedback**: How can we make color changes more visually obvious?
3. **Integration**: Should Color Creator and Scope Editor be more tightly integrated?

---

**Next Action**: Discuss color system approach and identify specific UX improvements needed before continuing scope expansion.
