# STUDIO1 DEVELOPMENT WHITEBOARD

*Current Session Action Items - Immediate Focus Only*

## üö® **CRITICAL RULES - READ BEFORE EDITING WHITEBOARD**

### **üîß Two CSS System Architecture - NEVER MIX:**
- **UI Dashboard** (`ui-components.css`): `--ui-*` colors, `.dashboard-*` classes (never user-editable)
- **Studio1 Content** (`main.css`): `.one` element, `--one-*` properties, direct HSLA (user content)
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Both share same JSON but serve different purposes!**

### **üè∑Ô∏è Naming Rules - NEVER CHANGE:**
- **Plugin**: "S4 Design System" (matches /s4/ folder - NEVER CHANGE)
- **Brand**: "Studio1 - The One Element System" (user-facing)

### **üìù Whiteboard Editing Rules:**
1. Read critical rules first
2. Understand two CSS system separation
3. Preserve plugin vs brand naming
4. Focus on immediate action items only
