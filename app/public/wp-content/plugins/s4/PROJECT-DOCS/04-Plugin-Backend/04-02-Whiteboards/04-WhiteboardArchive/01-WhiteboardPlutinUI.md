## ðŸ”® **NEXT PHASE PLANNING**

### **Priority 1: Two-Level Color Dropdown System**
**Goal**: Integrate BaseColorEditor + ColorCreator with Scope Editor

**Implementation Plan**:
- **First Dropdown**: Primary/Secondary/Neutral/Base color selection
- **Second Dropdown**: Custom variations from ColorCreator (e.g., "Primary Dark", "Primary Light")
- **Apply to Scopes**: Any scope property can use two-level color selection
- **Perfect Workflow**: Create base colors â†’ Create variations â†’ Apply to any scope

### **Priority 2: Advanced Scope Features**
**Goal**: Enhance individual scope system with advanced capabilities

**Planned Features**:
- **Scope Templates** - Pre-built title/subtitle/button scopes
- **Scope Inheritance** - Child scopes inherit from parent scopes
- **Scope Locking** - Prevent changes to foundational scopes
- **Scope Export** - Share scope definitions between projects

### **Priority 3: Component Preset System**
**Goal**: Build on individual scope foundation with component-level presets

**Architecture Vision**:
```html
<!-- Individual scope with component preset -->
<div data-scope="button-primary" data-preset="primary">
  <div class="one">Primary Button</div>
</div>

<div data-scope="button-primary" data-preset="secondary">
  <div class="one">Secondary Button</div>
</div>
```

### **Priority 4: Advanced Features**
**Goal**: Professional design tool capabilities

**Planned Enhancements**:
- **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Speed up editing workflow
- **Component Variants** - Size, state, interaction variants
- **Template Library** - Pre-built component collections
- **Export Options** - CSS, JSON, or code generation

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

### **Session Goals (Priority Order)**
1. **Two-Level Dropdown Implementation** - Integrate color systems with scope editor
2. **Test Color Workflow** - Complete Base â†’ Colors â†’ Scopes integration
3. **Advanced Scope Features** - Scope templates and inheritance system
4. **Documentation Update** - Move completed items to main docs

### **Success Criteria**
- âœ… Users can select core color + variation in scope editor
- âœ… Color changes flow through entire system seamlessly  
- âœ… Individual scopes + color presets work together perfectly
- âœ… Advanced scope features enhance user experience

## ðŸ“‹ **QUESTIONS FOR NEXT SESSION**

### **Technical Decisions**
1. **Dropdown UI**: What's the best UX for two-level color selection?
2. **Scope Templates**: Should we provide pre-built scopes or let users create all?
3. **Component Variants**: How should size/state variants integrate with color presets?
4. **Performance**: Any optimizations needed as scope system scales?

### **User Experience**
1. **Workflow**: What's the ideal flow from base colors â†’ variations â†’ scope application?
2. **Onboarding**: How do we guide users through the two-phase color system?
3. **Templates**: What pre-built scopes would be most valuable?
4. **Export**: What export formats are most important for users?
