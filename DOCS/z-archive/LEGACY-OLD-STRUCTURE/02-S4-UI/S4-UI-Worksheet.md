Currently we are working on testing out the card global scope system in our actual ui to use the same system we are building with the 4 layer system. 

In order to achieve this we will need to reorganize our current ui to match the S4 System. 

WHat i would like to do is create a new branch called UI-4LayerSystem and then we can work on reorganizing our ui to match the S4 System. I believe we may have already started this process but i am not sure where we left off. 

In order for this to work and for us to test properly we will need to update the ui theme and probably re build the json system and ui editor interface. 
Steps: 
1. Create a new branch called UI-4LayerSystem
2. REFACTOR UI Editor. Create a new full page ui editor interface for the json that is attached to the UI react component system theme etc. 
3. Remove the current ui editor button that is on the actul front end plugin usre interface and replace it with a hotkey command instead. 
4. Make sure we remove the old ui system after refactor

Next Steps: review and disucss the layout and functionality of the ui editor interface. and how we will impliment and oragnize it. 
note: i think the previous agent started to updat the card and scopes but i am not sure where we left off.
